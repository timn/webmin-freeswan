 This file describes the changes made to the FreeS/WAN Webmin Module.
 (Version history).


 Changes
 ==============================================================================
 Sep to      - Started the module while I was in the USA. We (Stephen Nodvin
 Dec 2000      and me) had the idea for this module while we were working on
               the RockSolid Box (http://www.rocksolidbox.net). We wanted to
               integrate VPN functionality and we wanted to be compatible to
               other system. So we chose the IPSec implementation of FreeS/WAN.
               I wrote all the edit_* pages and you can view all of the config. 
 27.12.2000  - Started the Save Functionality
 28.12.2000  - Wrote function section_save for easy save of settings
             - wrote save_ for debug, pluto
 29.12.2000  - Finished edit_mankey. It did not read the config but just
               display the form. Minor Changes to the form (for example to
               cover the %dns setting).
             - Finish save_mankey
             - Remove lots (tons) of bugs from freeswan-lib. Had to rewrite
               portions of parse_config. Used $_ because I'm so lazy. I better
               shouldn't have done that! Forgot get_section after all
               parse_config's in section_* functions :( It took me some time
               to find that one...
 30.12.2000  - Dummy pages for list_keys and view_status.
 (0.83.1)    - Finished edit_start
 (pre1)      - Declared 0.83.1-pre1 to Alpha for testers :-) I will finish the
               key managenment and connection status before release in Jan 2001



 To do
 ==============================================================================
 - Newbie Mode
 - Key Editing (ipsec.secrets)
